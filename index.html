      <p>It is a consensus in literature that living with impoverished conditions - in other words, people that have low incomes - entails living with other negative socioeconomic factors such as increased mortality, low school attendance, low health in relation to higher income people (Evans & English, 2002; Tilak, 2002).

      <h3>Aims, Hypotheses and Assumptions</h3>
      <div class="ahhtext"
      <p>Our aim is to explore what correlates with poverty - as measured by income - in London. We will look at various variables that represent a spectrum of factors that have been shown to be correlated with poverty in different settings, such as health, physical activity, and availability of green spaces.

This data is organised and measured by borough (Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Camden, City of London*, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Newham, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth, Westminster.)
<br>*The City of London is the 33rd principal division of Greater London but it is not a borough. For our purposes, however, we will be treating it as such.</br>
</p>

<p1>We have various hypotheses. These are:
<li>Higher levels poverty in a borough will correlate with lower levels of green spaces</li>
<li>Higher levels of poverty in a borough will correlate with lower levels of physical activity of children attending school</li>
<li>Higher levels of poverty in a borough will correlate with lower life expectancy</li>
<li>Higher levels of poverty in a borough will correlate with higher levels of drug use</li></p1>
<p>We assume that the factors investigated are representative of wider thematics. For example, we assume that area of green space is a valid indicator of environmental quality; physical activity of children in schools is a valid indicator of both physical activity and quality of education; life expectancy and drug use are valid indicators of health. While we acknowledge that none of the wider thematics can be reduced to these indicators alone, we believe the indicators chosen reveal relevant and important information concerning these areas.

<h3 class="w3-center">Literature Review</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">How does poverty relate to other living factors (pollution, health, education) in London?</p>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:32px">
<div class="text">
 <p>Poverty - or low income - is considered to be a deciding factor in defining one's socioeconomic status. Many studies have investigated what poverty is associated with; specifically, what other aspects influence the life of people that live in poverty.</p>

<p>Poverty has been shown to be related to many social aspects (Hsieh and Pugh, 1993) such as increase in crime (Hsieh and Pugh, 1993), decrease in health (Craig and Sonia, 2002; (Kaplan and Keil, 1993), decrease in education (Stephen J. Caldas & Carl Bankston (1997)), and increase in pollution (Susan A. Perlin , David Wong & Ken Sexton, 2001; McLeod et al. 2000). As such, people that live with poverty tend to have lower qualities of life - not only because they have low incomes but because of many other social factors that are associated with this.</p>

<p>More than being related to poverty, research has shown that a lot of these aspects decrease the ability of people getting out of poverty. Poverty has been shown in many cities to be related not only to individuals choices but to structural problems (Kasarda and Ting, 1996). In other words, people with poverty live with a lot of other problems that undermine their ability of getting out of poverty. So these aspects, such as low health and low education, affect not only individual's general wellbeing but their ability to improve their lives.</p>

<img src="https://surfaceview.s3.amazonaws.com/spree/products/12223/large/MOL0085-S4W-SV-Edits-Wall-Prints-2-Fold-2200x1750.png?1424169622" height="425" width="auto" alt="Image" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border-radius:20%">


<p>So knowing what aspects of life are associated with poverty is essential for two reasons. First, it allows us to improve the lives of people in poverty. Second, it allows us to improve the chances of these people getting out of poverty. By understanding all the variables at play we can work towards a comprehensive policy making that truly improves all the aspects that are negatively affecting low income people’s lives and aims at tackling the structural problems at place.</p>

<p>But what aspects of life are associated with poverty varies from place to place (McLeod et al. 2000). This is due to different policies in place e.g. US has a lot of income inequality which can be related to their tax policies. Different countries treat minorities differently e.g. African americans in the US suffer a lot and are disproportionately affect due to health risks as they are much more likely to live next to waste hazard facilities (Williams and Collins, 1995). Cultural differences also play a role (Brion et al. 2011). In some countries the culture of family is stronger therefore there is a family safety net regardless of the income of individuals.</p>

<p>So even though we have a general understanding that poverty related to other aspects from the literature. Knowing what aspects and therefore how to create policies to improve the living conditions of these individuals can only really be accessed at a local level. So far very few studies have focused on specific cities such as London.
In conclusion, the current literature highlights that knowing what associates with poverty is essential to improve the life of low income individuals as well as to increase their ability to get out of poverty. More so, it highlights that this should be done at the local level such as cities as policies vary a lot from country to country as well as relations to minority groups and culture.</p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">DATA</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Where did the data come from?</p>
  <div class="text">
<p class="w3-center"> All of our data came from the London Data Store (LDS), an official and local body for Greater London which consists of the Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan (Labour) and the London Assembly, all of whom are elected by the people.
</p>
 <p class="w3-center w3-large">Is the London Data Store a reliable source?</p>
<p class="w3-center">Being published by an official, reputable and accountable source gives the impression that the data is reliable. However, we remain aware that data collected under government parties (as it is currently) means there may be a political agenda underlying it. For example, Sadiq Khan is very outspoken about his wishes to clean London’s air and so may manipulate the data to make air quality seem worse than it actually is. However we feel this would be difficult to do, as the London Assembly are elected to examine decisions and actions taken by the Mayor, who they hold publicly and democratically accountable.<br>Furthermore, it is possible that some of the data, such as income data, are estimates or based on surveys. As such the appropriate caution was taken via team awareness of potential issues however we believe discrepancies in data wouldn't be too problematic and would also still paint an accurate picture of incomes per borough <b>relative</b> to each other</p>
 <p class="w3-center w3-large">Why did we choose the datasets we did and what do they represent?</p>
 <p class="w3-center">We decided to investigate 5 variables in our analysis, all of which  the literature review suggested as being related to poverty: income, green spaces, physical activity of kids in schools, drug use, life expectancy. All variables have values per borough of London. <br>Income data corresponds to...

<br>The life expectancy data corresponds to…

<br>The physical activity of kids in schools data corresponds to the percentage of kids that have access to at least 2h of physical activity in schools.

<br>Drug use data corresponds to..

<p class="w3-center">As one can note, there is a lot of variation in the data. However, conclusions can only be reached with the use of statistical tests (described and explained in the next section).
</p>

 <p class="w3-center w3-large">What problems were encountered regarding the data?</p>
<p class="w3-center">The majority of our issues arised in the data cleaning process. Due to the internationalisation on some of our laptops, converting ExCel files to CSV was difficult and we lost some data during the conversion. To work around this however, we would copy-paste the data from ExCel into Google Sheets, and export it into a CSV from there. After that it could be easily uploaded and manipulated on Python via Azure Notebooks.
</p>
<p class="w3-center">Due to the City of London's status as a "principal division" (rather than Borough) of London, its data was occasionally not included in our chosen datasets. This was the case with our "Active Kids" and "Life Expectancy" datasets. As such, we had to estimate what the missing values may have been; we considered this to be similiar or the same as the next richest Borough.</p>

<h3 class="w3-center">Statistical Methods</h3>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:32px">
    <p><b>What we used:</b>
<br>We had 4 different variables that we wanted to compare to average income in a London borough. We wanted to see if there was a correlation between the wealth of the borough – as estimated by the average income – and the variable (for example: if average income correlated with life expectancy).
<br>We used Azure Notebooks and the Python Pandas package to clean the data. For example:</p>
<p class="w3-center"> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fps3RdeZahqCTqRi-5MejgScdyrhFfpIn-ujBJwi3aL-8XtXhJ2rJfAbcqI1aTxGy4685tFNR56wqXSEmmErTOv9SGuzOpioTRDFrVmGL0lMCnmOpFv2rla2qMEjPS8D1DECF3Rp" style="border:solid; border-color:light-grey;" height="400" width="auto">
</p>
<p>We made a bar chart for each variable so that we could see the data visually:</p>
<p class="w3-center"> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/woQ-Z5KgC_Ia26fQBqtEzJRjlr61YJzNsk72SlYHd_inilSzDWRD-UcpnCon-9B7cLPsahpx6jJNeISixD2fmJI7-sq6oFkfbKgHdT-X4pCx9N22cAxFD6gpIW-CjbAUzZUkXlnw" style="border:solid; border-color:light-grey;" height="400" width="auto"></p>
<p>The bar chart wasn’t there to demonstrate the relationship in any way; it's use was just to give us an initial visual representation of each variable, and check that our values were working and so on (for example, the bar chart wouldn’t work until there were no N/A values, and all the values were stored as integers or floats).
</p>
<p>Then we ranked the data – we ranked the London Boroughs in terms of income and in terms of the variable, so that we could plot them against each other for a scatter plot and regression line. For example:
</p>
<p class="w3-center">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JjDWvn9jJ0sK3d8duFrYARAVj1eegIoq7Pq6Azyv45e6ojJj9hWgMKnxnSltVTpS8g7Ow3y9pM5EI2fso6GBGKyvCKy34wXlk2yOP6OHgcTmjXWzUkh8aaKbrY5mTDmKkWAgGpLl" height="275" width="auto" alt="Image" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display:inline-block; padding:20px;border:solid; border-color:light-grey;">

<p>We plotted the rank of the borough by income against the rank of the borough by variable, to see if we could see a relationship. This visual representation can show us whether there is a relationship, but not whether it is linear. </p>
<p>Then we used python to find the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients to give us a numerical value to our correlation.
</p>
<p class="w3-center"> <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aqbfmtXHmOmS8YMfIR0ZuY8mySOco-hKZKWP48tyeajMJMT4xiSopcH-vsuun_YkUpllf8w9NnnkOdCLqi4Udh_kbDVfbSPSKREcDr1pSzEeYLJRephowOYIDnzZro0J6ZlcFz77" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display:inline-block;border:solid; border-color:light-grey;"></p><p class="w3-center"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tnnN1DD9EgNX1vAqSOBpg_nbsEcc988__Ury_ZohpjyhS9V8FPNK2wrN2QUiS9LradfcfnazxJAp1kGhEM2nk_Yqw5KtirWPZE0D5chut71uV7T_C9sjrjSnZ3qw6goRsllqHn2p" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display:inline-block;border:solid; border-color:light-grey;"></p>
<p>The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can tell us how strong the correlation is, and also give us an indication of whether the relationship is linear.
<br>The Pearson correlation coefficient shows the extent to which there is a linear relationship between the variables. A coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1, a perfect negative correlation and 0, no correlation. If the variables increase together, but not consistently, the coefficient will be greater than 1. (“A comparison of the Pearson and Spearman correlation methods,” n.d.)
<br>The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated by dividing the covariance of the 2 variables by their standard deviations multiplied together (Boslaugh, 2012).</p>
<p class="w3-center"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pZdxUSFloh-MJK3PjXrWfq05mH3XSb_3g_vI-iPujlCGUlvm9uaysiPZNL-b5wHrrBsu8IO0WmlIwkSCCAWFOJUrAzFR63bpeHJeDkj0q_-0I0C0vCG4d9X8Ul1ZRGuw74i4T5Py"></p>
<p>The covariance is the unstandardized measurement for the linear relationship between two variables. The standard deviation is used to standardise this measurement to produce a value between 1 and -1 for linear relationships.
<br>The Spearman Correlation shows how well the relationship between the variables can be described using a monotonic function. A monotonic function is a function that is either entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing, for example:
</p>
<p class="w3-center"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WQEW2E8MFscrJBK9-5tYdPedl8I1ndvPOCFwrqZF6oWqQjHwhViwdoaVEG9seMAN3BJ6HBUhfe_MLFNN3PkILX7t84jmOts4f2eG2IepAj9iZTX5s747iKD1eWh2f0iw_S2Ag9tK"></p>
<p>In Figure 1, the graph of the relationship between X and Y never has a negative gradient.
<br>The Spearman Correlation Coefficient can show us if there is a strong relationship between the variables, even if that relationship is non-linear. For a strong positive correlation between variables, even if the correlation is not consistent, the Spearman Correlation Coefficient will give a value close to 1.
<br>The Spearman Correlation Coefficient is calculated in the same way as the Pearson, however the values are ranked using Spearman’s rank first. In our investigation this just meant each borough was given a number 1 to 32 (as there are 32 London boroughs), for income and for each variable, (e.g. Life Expectancy) and then the Correlation Coefficient was calculated from these rankings.
<br></p>
<p class="w3-large">Limitations</p>
<p>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient only produces a meaningful value to measure the strength of correlation if the variables are linearly correlated, this is why we calculated the Spearman coefficient as well.
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/w0B7WkWQ_fDj3oTEUpvMNM0pFwCooIsxXnlg5zFIqckOZCEtysS-36sfX-DlECLukMuL6Px9fcWaX1R9aHg-e46RI8U7P3m_3ySMneUdz6Z8j7k0-silHLHICSFhhi2GXCubhJF9" alt="Image" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px">

<br>Furthermore, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient is particularly sensitive to outliers (“Pearson Product-Moment Correlation - Guidelines to interpretation of the coefficient, detecting outliers and the type of variables needed.,” n.d.). The Spearman Coefficient is also more robust in this respect, however we will still consider this sensitivity when interpreting our results, and if appropriate, remove extreme outliers from the dataset.
<br>The Spearman, like the Pearson Correlation Coefficient does not account for any relationship that is non-monotonic, for example, the relationship shown in Figure 2, would produce a Spearman and Pearson coefficient equal to 0.
</p>
<p>The Spearman coefficient is more robust to extreme outliers than the Pearson coefficient because it limits the value of the outlier to its rank. However, it can’t tell us whether the relationship between the variables is linear or otherwise. Furthermore, the ranking washes out some of the correlation, as we can no longer tell how much Y increased as a result of X. We can interpret the Spearman Correlation Coefficient to be how sure we are that there is a correlation, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to represent how linear the relationship is.

    <p>We chose Github as the platform on which to host our site as it is possible for everybody to contribute to it without needing a password/email combination - we simply had to join the repository for the site and download Github Desktop. The code was written using the text editor Atom, and changes were then pushed to the repository via Github Desktop, appearing on our site. We used the help of a w3.css stylesheet to build the site, adapting it to suit our needs (for example, by building a navigation bar and increasing the margins so that the text read more easily as initially it read from one end of the screen to the other, which is fairly irritating.) Github was also a suitable platform on which to host our visualisations.

<h3 class="w3-center">The Story the Data Tells</h3>
    <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:32px">
    <p>Research shows that poverty or in other words lack of income is correlated with a lot of aspects such as health problems, environmental pollution and others. However, research also shows that what relates to poverty changes from place to place. This research has attempted to explore whether income per borough as a measure of poverty is associated to 4 variables that are considered to be relevant indicators of education, environment, physical exercise and health: green spaces, life expectancy, drug use, physical activity in schools.

<br>Figure 1 shows income data from all the London boroughs over time.

<br>Insert figure

<br>We tried to focus on the most recent data on all datasets so we use data from X for income.

<br>After gathering data on these aspects in all London boroughs, we explored whether there was an association between these variables and income.

<br>The following figure shows data on income next to data on green spaces.

<br>Insert figure

<br>The visualisation does not seem to suggest a very strong association between the two variables. The application of statistical measures supports this finding a very weak relationship between these two variables. Interesting though it finds this as a negative relation meaning that lower income boroughts seem to weakly correlated with more green spaces. This is specially interesting as countries like the USA are famous in research for having the opposite relation.
The following figure shows data on income next to data on life expectancy.

<br>Insert figure

<br>The visualisation seems to suggest some relationship between the two variables. The application of statistical measures supports this finding a moderate to strong positive relationship between income in each borough and life expectancy meaning that boroughts with higher income tend to have higher life expectancy.

<br>The following figure shows data on income next to data on drug use.

<br>Insert figure

<br>The visualisation does not seem to show a clear pattern. The application of statistical methods suggests no clear relationship between the two variables. This is specially interesting since both this variable and life expectancy can be considered indicators of health. However, both are associated differently to income.

<br>The following figure shows data on income next to data on physical activity in schools.

<br>Insert figure

<br>There seems to be some relationship between the variables. The application of statistical methods suggests a weak positive relationship between the two variables meaning that boroughts with higher levels of income seem to be weakly associated with higher levels of physical activity in children.

<br>Overall, there are a few very interesting conclusions that can be taken from this research. First, there are clear differences between relations of variables with income in London than in other places such as the USA. This adds evidence to the claim that motivated this research: that associations with income can only be ascertained in case-studies. Further, the results here suggest that even indicators of the same aspect can have different relationships to income. The key word seems then to be complexity. The relation between income and other aspects relevant to the life of individuals seems to be very complex.

<br>Further studies should keep focusing on looking at specific indicators of various aspects relevant to human life. This specific research seems to suggest that in order to improve the life of low income individuals, one should focus on policies that lead to an increase in life expectancy as well as physical activity in children. In the specific case of London, a focus on green spaces and drug use while it might improve the life of all citizens in general are not good areas to focus if one pretends to improve the life of low income individuals in comparison to other income groups.
